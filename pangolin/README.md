# Pangolin workflow

Material for the second part of the tutorial, automating a workflow for assigning VCF files to a particular SARS-CoV-2 lineage using the Pangolin tool.

The `data/` directory contains data to be processed during the tutorial, divided into 10 batches, each of which should be used for a separate workflow invocation. It also included the `NC_045512.2_reference_sequence.fasta` viral genome. The `solutions/` directory contains two scripts which might be useful for the automation (in the tutorial, you are encouraged to find your own solution, however).
